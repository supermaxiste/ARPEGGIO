# This file explains where do the example reads come from
# With seqtk, while genome BS-seq data was sampled for 4 individuals:
# - one parental species
# - one other parental species
# - two allopolyploids
The sampling used the seed 100 because data was paired-end and pairs needed to be kept.
All the example files contain 100'000 reads randomly sampled from the original files.
